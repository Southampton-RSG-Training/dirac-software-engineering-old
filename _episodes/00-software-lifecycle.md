## Typical Software Development in Academia

FIXME: differences between a programmer/code and a software engineer, and why the latter matters - reuse introductory slide material from ISWC

FIXME: a typical academic process of development, and the problems inherent in it. Typically, unbalanced focus on implementation and not understanding what is required and what needs to happen afterwards - reuse introductory slide material from ISWC

> ## A challenge
> 
> Have you used any academically-produced software in your work, or perhaps developed some yourself? What was good about it, what were its shortcomings, and what aspects do you think should have been given greater attention during its development (or even afterwards)?
{: .challenge}


## The Software Development Process

FIXME: how a process solves the above problems - predictability, separation of concerns, etc.

FIXME: the basic stages of a typical software development process - requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, release, maintenance. Whether you are aware of them or not, these stages are followed implicitly or explicitly in every software project

> ## A challenge
>
> For your software example used in the first exercise (or perhaps another), for each aspect that needed improvement, within which stage do you think that aspect should have been addressed?
{: .challenge}


## Different Models of Development

FIXME: show alternative arrangements of how the process can work, e.g. agile, v-model?
